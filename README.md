# opensource COBOL 4J

[日本語版README](./README_JP.md)

"opensource COBOL 4J" is a COBOL compiler that translates COBOL parograms to Java programs.
This compiler is deeply inspired by ["opensource COBOL"](https://github.com/opensourcecobol/opensource-cobol) which translates COBOL programs to C programs.
(In fact, this repository contains a lot of source files of ["opensource COBOL"](https://github.com/opensourcecobol/opensource-cobol))
