# opensource COBOL 4J

[日本語版README](./README_JP.md)

"opensource COBOL 4J" is a COBOL compiler that translates COBOL programs to Java programs.
This compiler is deeply inspired by ["opensource COBOL"](https://github.com/opensourcecobol/opensource-cobol) which translates COBOL programs to C programs.
(In fact, this repository contains a lot of source files of ["opensource COBOL"](https://github.com/opensourcecobol/opensource-cobol))

[CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) contains all notable changes.

## Requirements and Installation

See [Installation page](https://github.com/opensourcecobol/opensourcecobol4j/wiki).

## Usage

Compile.
```bash
cobj [COBOL source file]
```
("cobj" command produces [PROGRAM-ID].java and [PROGRAM-ID].class in the current directory.)

Run.
```bash
java [PROGRAM-ID]
```

## The progress of the development


Implemented.

* Data calculation (MOVE, COMPUTE, ... )
* Control statements (IF, PERFORM, GO TO, ...)
* Some I/O functions (DISPLAY, ACCEPT, ...)
* Call statements
* Sequential files
* Indexed files
* Relative files
* Sort statements
* Embedded functions (ACOS, LENGTH, MAX, ...)
