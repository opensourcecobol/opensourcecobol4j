# opensource COBOL 4j

[日本語版README](https://github.com/opensourcecobol/opensourcecobol4j/blob/develop/README_JP.md)

"opensource COBOL 4j" is a COBOL compiler that translates COBOL parograms to Java programs.
This compiler is deeply inspired by ["opensource COBOL"](https://github.com/opensourcecobol/opensource-cobol) which translates COBOL programs to C programs.
(In fact, this repository contains a lot of source files of ["opensource COBOL"](https://github.com/opensourcecobol/opensource-cobol))

## Requirements and Installation

See [Installation page](https://github.com/opensourcecobol/opensourcecobol4j/wiki/Installation).

## Usage

Compile.
```bash
cobc [COBOL source file]
```
("cobc" command produces [PROGRAM-ID].java and [PROGRAM-ID].class in the current directory.)

Run.
```bash
java -cp "$CLASSPATH:./build" [PROGRAM-ID]
```

## The progress of the development

The functions in the following "implemented" list are tested using [NIST COBOL85 test suite](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div897/ctg/cobol_form.htm)
and **99%** of the test cases are passed.

Implemented.

* Data calculation (MOVE, COMPUTE, ... )
* Control statements (IF, PERFORM, GO TO, ...)
* Some I/O functions (DISPLAY, ACCEPT, ...)
* Call statements
* Sequential files
* Indexed files
* Sort statements
* Embedded functions (ACOS, LENGTH, MAX, ...)

Not Implemented.

* Relative files

Known bugs
