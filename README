"opensource COBOL" is open-source COBOL compiler, an extension of the Japan-specific features.
"opensource COBOL4J" translates COBOL program to java code and compiles it using OpenJDK.

opensource COBOL was forked from OpenCOBOL in 2012.

============
Requirements
============

  ***
     NOTE
	For all the following packages (required or optional),
	BOTH runtime AND development components are necessary.
  ***

opensource COBOL requires the following external libraries to be installed:

  o GNU Libtool (libltdl)
    http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/libtool.html

    ***
	NOTE - libltdl is NOT needed when installing on Linux
	or Windows (including Cygwin and MingW).
    ***

    libltdl is used to implement dynamic CALL statements.

    GNU Libtool is distributed under GNU Lesser General Public License.

  **

The following libraries ARE required WHEN :

1) Indexed-Sequential file I/O is used

  o Oracle Berkeley DB Java Edition je-7.5.11 or later
    http://www.oracle.com/

    BOTH runtime AND development components required.

    Recommended is version je-7.5.11 is known to have problems.

    * NOTE *

    Berkeley DB Java Edition is distributed under the
	Apache License, Version 2.0.


============
Installation
============

  **
	NOTE
	Due to deficiencies in the tools used to prepare
	opensource COBOL (autoconf/automake/libtool), it is
	NOT generally possible to use path names with
	spaces embedded within them (Mainly Cygwin/MingW/Windows ports).
  **
 
To generate/install opensource COBOL on Linux:

**************************************

    ./configure
    make

 Here you may run
    make check
 to run a series of opensource COBOL test programs (must do!)
 This MUST succeed - If not, please report.

    make install

** NOTE **
   On Linux systems, if you are installing for the
   -first- time, you may need to run "ldconfig" (as root).
   In fact, it does not hurt if you always do this.

** NOTE **
   On some Red Hat (Fedora) installations and
   possibly other Linux distros, /usr/local/lib
   is NOT automatically searched at runtime. 
   Edit /etc/ld.so.conf and add /usr/local/lib to the file.
   Rerun "ldconfig".

    ./compile_libcobj.sh

** NOTE **
   libcobj's make is not ready yet, please run the alternative script.

**************************************

If you think you have a problem or just want to
record the make output, just redirect the output thus :
    make 1>mymake.log 2>&1
    make install 1>myinstall.log 2>&1

**************************************

You can get back to a clean installation status by running :
    make distclean

**************************************

The "make install" will default to "/usr/local" as
the install path. You may override this by specifying
"--prefix=<your install path>" to the "./configure"
command.

***********************************************************

============

The following is only interesting for advanced use.
A normal user should not have recourse to use these
options.

There are the following configure options:

  --with-cc=<cc>		Specify C compiler command used by cobc
				Do not specify this unless you know what
				you are doing!

  --with-db1			Use Berkeley DB 1.85 (libdb1/libdb-1.85)
				This overrides --with-db/--without-db

  --with-db			Use Berkeley DB 3.0 or later (libdb)
				This is the default

  --without-db			Do not use Berkeley DB
				You will not be able to use SORT/indexed I/O

  --with-dl			Use the system dynamic linker instead of ltdl
				This is the default
				(Note on Windows, native loading is used)

  --without-dl			Use ltdl for dynamic program loading

  --with-patch-level=<n>	Set internal patch level to n (default 0)

  --with-varseq=<n>		Define the format for variable length sequential
				files. For values of 0, 1 and 2, four bytes are
				written preceeding each record. The format of
				these four bytes for values of 0, 1, 2 is
				as follows :
				n = 0 (default)
					The first 2 bytes are the record length
					in big-endian order. This is compatible
					with mainframe. Bytes 3 and 4 are set
					to binary 0.
				n = 1
					The 4 bytes are the record length in
					big-endian order.
				n = 2
					The 4 bytes are the record length in
					native machine order (int).
					(This was previously the default)

				For the value of 3, two bytes are written
				preceeding each record :
				n = 3
					The first 2 bytes are the record length
					in big-endian order. The record follows
					immediately after beginning at byte 3.

  --enable-debug		Add '-g' debug option to make

============

============
Development
============

If you wish to hack the opensource COBOL source code, proceed
as follows.

You need to install the following extra packages with specified
minimum version before changing/building opensource COBOL:

For compiling :
  o Bison 1.875
  o Flex 2.5.4

If you reconfigure and/or prepare a distribution
  o Autoconf 2.59
  o Automake 1.9.6
  o Libtool 1.5.24
  o m4 1.4.2
  o Gettext 0.14.1
  o Texinfo 4.6 (For makeinfo)

If you modify top-level configure.ac, Makefile.am in any directory,
or any of the standard OC tests then you will need to
run "autoreconf -I m4" to regenerate the necessary files.
