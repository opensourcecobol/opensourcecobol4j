*****************

* Menu:

* Hello World!::                Hello World!


File: open-cobol.info,  Node: Hello World!,  Prev: Getting Started,  Up: Getting Started

1.1 Hello World!
================

This is a sample program that displays "Hello World":

     ---- hello.cob -------------------------
           * Sample COBOL program
            IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
            PROGRAM-ID. hello.
            PROCEDURE DIVISION.
            DISPLAY "Hello World!".
            STOP RUN.
     ----------------------------------------

   The compiler is 'cobc', which is executed as follows:

     $ cobc -x hello.cob
     $ ./hello
     Hello World!

   The executable file name (i.e., 'hello' in this case) is determined
by removing the extension from the source file name.

   You can specify the executable file name by specifying the compiler
option '-o' as follows:

     $ cobc -x -o hello-world hello.cob
     $ ./hello-world
     Hello World!

2.1 Compiler Options
====================

The compiler 'cobc' accepts the options described in this section.

* Menu:

* Built Target::                Built Target
* Source Format::               Source Format
* Warning Options::             Warning Options


File: open-cobol.info,  Node: Built Target,  Next: Source Format,  Prev: Compiler Options,  Up: Compiler Options

2.1.1 Built Target
------------------

The following options specify the target type produced by the compiler:

'-E'
     Preprocess only.  Compiler directives are executed.  Comment lines
     are removed.  COPY statements are expanded.  The output goes to the
     standard-out.

'-C'
     Translation only.  COBOL source files are translated into C files.
     The output is saved in file '*.c'.

'-S'
     Compile only.  Translated C files are compiled by cc.  The output
     is saved in file '*.s'.

'-c'
     Compile and assemble.  This is equivalent to 'cc -c'.  The output
     is saved in file '*.o'.

'-m'
     Compile, assemble, and build a dynamically loadable module (i.e., a
     shared library).  The output is saved in file '*.so'.  (1).

'-x'
     Include the main function in the output.

     This option takes effect at the translation stage.  If you give
     this option with '-C', you will see the main function at the end of
     the generated C file.

   Without any options above, the compiler tries to build a dynamically
loadable module.

2.1.2 Source Format
-------------------

OpenCOBOL supports both fixed and free source format.

   The default format is the fixed format.  This can be explicitly
overwritten by one of the following options:

'-free'
     Free format.

'-fixed'
     Fixed format.

2.2 Multiple Sources
====================

A program often consists of multiple source files.  This section
describes how to compile multiple source files.

   This section also describes how to build a shared library that can be
used by any COBOL programs and how to use external libraries from COBOL
programs.

* Static Linking::              Compiling into a single executable
* Dynamic Linking::             A main program and separate modules

* Using Library::               Using external libraries


File: open-cobol.info,  Node: Static Linking,  Next: Dynamic Linking,  Prev: Multiple Sources,  Up: Multiple Sources

2.2.1 Static Linking
--------------------

The easiest way of combining multiple files is to compile them into a
single executable.

   One way is to specify all files on the command line:

     $ cobc -x -o prog main.cob subr1.cob subr2.cob

   Another way is to compile each file with the option '-c', and link
them at the end.  The top-level program must be compiled with the option
'-x':

     $ cobc -c subr1.cob
     $ cobc -c subr2.cob
     $ cobc -c -x main.cob
     $ cobc -x -o prog main.o subr1.o subr2.o

   You can link C routines as well using either method:

   Method 1:
     $ cobc -o prog main.cob subrs.c

   Method 2:
     $ cc -c subrs.c
     $ cobc -c -x main.cob
     $ cobc -x -o prog main.o subrs.o

   Any number of functions can be contained in a single C file.

   The linked programs will be called dynamically; that is, the symbol
will be resolved at run time.  For example, the following COBOL
statement

     CALL "subr" USING X.

   will be converted into an equivalent C code like this:

     int (*func)() = cob_resolve("subr");
     if (func != NULL)
       func (X);

   With the compiler options '-fstatic-call', more efficient code will
be generated like this:

     subr(X);

   Note that this option is effective only when the called program name
is a literal (like 'CALL "subr".').  With a data name (like 'CALL
SUBR.'), the program is still called dynamically.

2.2.2 Dynamic Linking
---------------------

There are two methods to achieve this.  Method 1 (Using driver program).
Compile all programs with the option '-m':
     $ cobc -m main.cob subr.cob
   This creates shared object files 'main.so subr.so' (1).

   Before running the main program, install the module files in your
library directory:
     $ cp subr.so /your/cobol/lib
   Set the environment variable 'COB_LIBRARY_PATH' to your library
directory, and run the main program:
     $ export COB_LIBRARY_PATH=/your/cobol/lib
   Note: You may set the variable to directly point to the directory
where you compiled the sources.

   Now execute your program:
     $ cobcrun main

   Method 2.  The main program and subprograms can be compiled
separately.

   The main program is compiled as usual:
     $ cobc -x -o main main.cob

   Subprograms are compiled with the option '-m':
     $ cobc -m subr.cob
   This creates a module file 'subr.so' (2).

   Before running the main program, install the module files in your
library directory:
     $ cp subr.so /your/cobol/lib

   Now, set the environment variable 'COB_LIBRARY_PATH' to your library
directory, and run the main program:
     $ export COB_LIBRARY_PATH=/your/cobol/lib
     $ ./main

2.2.3 Building Library
----------------------

You can build a shared library by combining multiple COBOL programs and
even C routines:

     $ cobc -c subr1.cob
     $ cobc -c subr2.cob
     $ cc -c subr3.c
     $ cc -shared -o libsubrs.so subr1.o subr2.o subr3.o


File: open-cobol.info,  Node: Using Library,  Prev: Building Library,  Up: Multiple Sources

2.2.4 Using Library
-------------------

You can use a shared library by linking it with your main program.

   Before linking the library, install it in your system library
directory:
     $ cp libsubrs.so /usr/lib
   or install it somewhere else and set 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH':
     $ cp libsubrs.so /your/cobol/lib
     $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/your/cobol/lib

   Then, compile the main program, linking the library as follows:
     $ cobc -x main.cob -L/your/cobol/lib -lsubrs

File: open-cobol.info,  Node: Main C Program,  Next: Static C to COBOL,  Prev: C Interface,  Up: C Interface

2.3.1 Writing Main Program in C
-------------------------------

Include 'libcob.h' in your C program.  Call 'cob_init' before using any
COBOL module:

     #include <libcob.h>

     int
     main (int argc, char **argv)
     {
       /* initialize your program */
       ...

       /* initialize the COBOL run-time library */
       cob_init (argc, argv);

       /* rest of your program */
       ...

       /* Clean up and terminate - This does not return */
       cob_stop_run (return_status);

     }

   You can write 'cobc_init(0, NULL);' if you do not want to pass
command line arguments to COBOL.

   You can compile your C program as follows:

     cc -c `cob-config --cflags` main.c

   The compiled object must be linked with libcob as follows:

     cc -o main main.o `cob-config --libs`

2.3.2 Static linking with COBOL programs
----------------------------------------

Let's call the following COBOL module from a C program:

     ---- say.cob ---------------------------
            IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
            PROGRAM-ID. say.
            ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.
            DATA DIVISION.
            LINKAGE SECTION.
            01 HELLO PIC X(6).
            01 WORLD PIC X(6).
            PROCEDURE DIVISION USING HELLO WORLD.
            DISPLAY HELLO WORLD.
            EXIT PROGRAM.
     ----------------------------------------

   This program accepts two arguments, displays them, and exit.

   From the viewpoint of C, this is equivalent to a function having the
following prototype:

     extern int say(char *hello, char *world);

   So, your main program will look like as follows:

     ---- hello.c ---------------------------
     #include <libcob.h>

     extern int say(char *hello, char *world);

     int
     main()
     {
       int ret;
       char hello[7] = "Hello ";
       char world[7] = "World!";

       cob_init(0, NULL);

       ret = say(hello, world);

       return ret;
     }
     ----------------------------------------

   Compile these programs as follows:

     $ cc -c `cob-config --cflags` hello.c
     $ cobc -c -static say.cob
     $ cobc -x -o hello hello.o say.o
     $ ./hello
     Hello World!


File: open-cobol.info,  Node: Dynamic C to COBOL,  Next: Static COBOL to C,  Prev: Static C to COBOL,  Up: C Interface

2.3.3 Dynamic linking with COBOL programs
-----------------------------------------

You can find a COBOL module having a specific PROGRAM-ID by using a C
function 'cob_resolve', which takes the module name as a string and
returns a pointer to the module function.

   'cob_resolve' returns NULL if there is no module.  In this case, the
function 'cob_resolve_error' returns the error message.

   Let's see an example:

     ---- hello-dynamic.c -------------------
     #include <libcob.h>

     static int (*say)(char *hello, char *world);

     int
     main()
     {
       int ret;
       char hello[7] = "Hello ";
       char world[7] = "World!";

       cob_init(0, NULL);

       /* find the module with PROGRAM-ID "say". */
       say = cob_resolve("say");

       /* if there is no such module, show error and exit */
       if (say == NULL) {
         fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", cob_resolve_error ());
         exit(1);
       }

       /* call the module found and exit with the return code */
       ret = say(hello, world);

       return ret;
     }
     ----------------------------------------

   Compile these programs as follows:

     $ cc -c `cob-config --cflags` hello-dynamic.c
     $ cobc -x -o hello hello-dynamic.o
     $ cobc -m say.cob
     $ export COB_LIBRARY_PATH=.
     $ ./hello
     Hello World!


File: open-cobol.info,  Node: Static COBOL to C,  Next: Dynamic COBOL to C,  Prev: Dynamic C to COBOL,  Up: C Interface

2.3.4 Static linking with C programs
------------------------------------

Let's call the following C function from COBOL:

     ---- say.c -----------------------------
     int
     say(char *hello, char *world)
     {
       int i;
       for (i = 0; i < 6; i++)
         putchar(hello[i]);
       for (i = 0; i < 6; i++)
         putchar(world[i]);
       putchar('\n');
       return 0;
     }
     ----------------------------------------

   This program is equivalent to the foregoing 'say.cob'.

   Note that, unlike C, the arguments passed from COBOL programs are not
terminated by the null character (i.e., '\0').

   You can call this function in the same way you call COBOL programs:

     ---- hello.cob -------------------------
            IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
            PROGRAM-ID. hello.
            ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.
            DATA DIVISION.
            WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
            01 HELLO PIC X(6) VALUE "Hello ".
            01 WORLD PIC X(6) VALUE "World!".
            PROCEDURE DIVISION.
            CALL "say" USING HELLO WORLD.
            STOP RUN.
     ----------------------------------------

   Compile these programs as follows:

     $ cc -c say.c
     $ cobc -c -static -x hello.cob
     $ cobc -x -o hello hello.o say.o
     $ ./hello
     Hello World!

2.3.5 Dynamic linking with C programs
-------------------------------------

You can create a dynamic-linking module from a C program by passing an
option '-shared' to the C compiler:

     $ cc -shared -o say.so say.c
     $ cobc -x hello.cob
     $ export COB_LIBRARY_PATH=.
     $ ./hello
     Hello World!

4.1 Optimize Options
====================

There are three compiler options for optimization: '-O', '-Os' and
'-O2'.  These options enable optimization at both translation (from
COBOL to C) and compilation (C to assembly) levels.

   Currently, there is no difference between these optimization options
at the translation level.

   The option '-O', '-Os' or '-O2' is passed to the C compiler as it is
and used for C level optimization.


File: open-cobol.info,  Node: Optimize Call,  Next: Optimize Binary,  Prev: Optimize Options,  Up: Optimize

4.2 Optimize Call
=================

When a CALL statement is executed, the called program is linked at run
time.  By specifying the compiler option '-fstatic-call', you can
statically link the program at compile time and call it efficiently.
(*note Static Linking::)


File: open-cobol.info,  Node: Optimize Binary,  Prev: Optimize Call,  Up: Optimize

4.3 Optimize Binary
===================

By default, data items of usage binary or comp are stored in the
big-endian form.  On those machines whose native byte order is
little-endian, this is not quite efficient.

   If you prefer, you can store binary items in the native form of your
machine.  Set the config option 'binary-byteorder' to 'native' in your
config file (*note Customize::).

   In addition, setting the option 'binary-size' to '2-4-8' or '1-2-4-8'
is more efficient than others.

5.1 Debug Options
=================

The compiler option '-debug' can be used during the development of your
programs.  It enables all run-time error checking, such as subscript
boundary checks and numeric data checks, and displays run-time errors
with source locations.

   The compiler option '-g' includes line directives in the output.
This helps debugging your COBOL programs using GDB, but this feature is
not complete and not very useful yet.
