How to run the NIST CCVS85 (aka. ANSI85) Test Suite
=====================================

*NOTE* It is expected that WARNING messages appear
when running the test.

*NOTE* The language interpreter "perl" is required to run these tests.

The final command of the the test is a diff between
expected results and actual results.
ie. diff summary.txt summary.log
If there is any output from this command, please
tar and compress the complete cobol85 directory
and report this to the OC list. You will receive
further instructions where to send this.

*NOTE* This test can take a long time depending
on your hardware.

1. Run the test suite:

	cd tests/cobol85
	make test

2. Test report summary will be put in summary.log.

3. When rerunning test as a result of a change, always
   do a "make clean" before "make test"

4. The default OC configuration tests are NC SM IC SQ RL IX ST SG OB IF

Make Options
------------

- make test     run the test suite
- make save     save test reports in *.txt
- make diff     diff from *.txt to the last reports
